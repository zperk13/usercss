# usercss
User css style overrides I made. Applied with [Stylus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/). Styles are mainly to add gruvbox colors, but other tweaks made be made. You're free to use these styles if you want but I can't guarantee that colors will be the only thing I touch.

    - Gruvbox
    - html and body set to have min-height of 100dvh
